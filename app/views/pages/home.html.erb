<h1>Percival J. Loyola</h1>
<p>Developer</p>
<p> Iâ€™m a startup guy. I love to build out cool ideas that solve problems with people who are just as driven to create. As a Developer and General Assembly graduate I've grown my potential as a technical talent, as well as expand my talents in rapid product ideation, prototyping and in building cooperation among a group to realize one inspired idea.</p>
